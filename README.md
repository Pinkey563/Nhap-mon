_ This was my project in the first semester at university.

_ We made the alarm system using infrared waves. This can be used at home, school's dormitory with affordable price.

_ This github includes 3 parts:
  + Report
  + Electric circuit
  + Code

_ To use it, you need to install Proteus 8 professional for the circuit and Arduino for the code

_ Feel free to contact me if you have any problem!
